I'm Ian

21, San Diego (originally Seattle). Former SWE intern at Cluely.

I like to work across the stack on consumer products.

Currently building:
Speech-to-speech sales practice app (think Hyperbound but consumer+mobile focused)

What I care about:
- Mobile apps 😊
- Building products people actually use daily
- IoT projects
- Speech to speech AI simulations
