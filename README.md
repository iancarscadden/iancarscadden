I'm Ian

21, San Diego (originally Seattle). Prev [SWE summer intern at Cluely](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7387529569102221312/).

I like to work across the stack on consumer products.

Currently building:
Speech-to-speech sales practice app (think Hyperbound but consumer+mobile focused)

What I care about:
- Mobile apps 😊
- Building products people actually use
- IoT projects
- Speech to speech AI simulations
